## Email 1: Welcome Email (Sent Immediately)

**Subject:** Welcome to the journey - Your speaking confidence starts here

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to our community of future confident speakers! I'm Peter Stoyanov, and I'm thrilled you've joined the waitlist.

Over my 20+ years as an actor, clown, and communication coach, I've learned one fundamental truth: the fear of public speaking isn't something to eliminate - it's energy to harness. That butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling? It's your body preparing to do something important.

Here's what to expect from me over the next few weeks:
- Practical techniques drawn from theater and psychology
- Real transformation stories from professionals just like you  
- Simple exercises you can practice anywhere
- Insights that turn anxiety into your secret weapon

I believe every professional has important ideas worth sharing. My job is helping you share them with the confidence they deserve.

Your speaking journey starts now - not when you feel "ready."

To your success,
Peter

P.S. Save my email address - I'll be sharing some powerful insights that you won't want to miss.

**Subject:** The 30-second technique that transforms speaking anxiety

Hi [First Name],

Remember that moment when you realize you have to speak up in a meeting, and your heart starts racing? Here's what's actually happening - and how to use it to your advantage.

**The Stand and State Technique** (borrowed from my theater training):

When you feel speaking anxiety rising, don't fight it. Instead:
1. Stand up (even briefly)
2. Take one deep breath through your nose
3. Say to yourself: "This energy means I care about this message"
4. Deliver your first sentence with that energy

The magic happens when you reframe anxiety as excitement. Your nervous system can't tell the difference - but your confidence can.

I learned this during my clown training. Before every performance, I'd feel that familiar flutter. The breakthrough came when my mentor said, "That feeling isn't fear - it's your body getting ready to connect."

Try this before your next presentation, meeting contribution, or even an important conversation. Notice how the energy that once felt like an enemy becomes fuel for your message.

The goal isn't to eliminate nerves - it's to make them work for you.

Keep practicing,
Peter

P.S. Professional speakers still get nervous. The difference? We've learned to dance with the feeling instead of fighting it.

**Subject:** How Sarah went from silent in meetings to leading presentations

Hi [First Name],

Sarah was a brilliant marketing director who had great ideas but rarely spoke up. Sound familiar?

"I'd prepare talking points before meetings," she told me, "but when the moment came, I'd just... freeze. My mind would go blank, and I'd convince myself someone else would say it better."

After six months of coaching, Sarah not only contributed regularly in meetings - she became the go-to person for client presentations.

**Here's what changed everything:**

Instead of fighting her perfectionist tendencies, we worked WITH them. Sarah learned to prepare not just content, but confidence cues:

- She developed a 3-point structure for any contribution: "I believe...", "Here's why...", "Here's how we move forward..."
- We practiced the "theater technique" of stepping into character - in her case, the confident expert she already was
- She started viewing speaking opportunities as gifts to her colleagues, not performances for judgment

The turning point came during a crucial client pitch. Sarah's presentation was so compelling that the client said, "We need someone who communicates with this kind of clarity leading our project."

That's the power of authentic confidence - when you stop performing and start sharing what matters to you, everything shifts.

Your voice matters more than you realize.

Cheering you on,
Peter

P.S. Sarah still gets nervous before big presentations. The difference? She now knows that feeling means she's about to do something important.

**Subject:** Try this 5-minute confidence builder (works anywhere)

Hi [First Name],

Here's a practical exercise I use with executives who need to build speaking confidence quickly. It works whether you have a presentation tomorrow or just want to feel more confident in conversations.

**The "Confident Speaker Choreography" Exercise:**

Find 5 minutes of private space (your office, bedroom, even a bathroom works).

**Step 1:** Stand tall, shoulders back. Walk across the room as if you're approaching your audience. Notice your posture, pace, and energy.

**Step 2:** Practice your opening line - ANY opening line. It could be "Good morning everyone" or "I have an idea I'd like to share." Say it three times, focusing on:
- Clear, deliberate pacing (slower than feels natural)
- Eye contact with imaginary listeners
- Breathing through your nose between words

**Step 3:** End with what I call the "Oscar moment" - acknowledge your imaginary audience with a slight nod and genuine smile, as if accepting appreciation.

This isn't about perfection - it's about muscle memory. When you practice confident movement privately, your body remembers it publicly.

I learned this choreography principle from years of theater training. Every confident moment on stage starts with confident movement in rehearsal.

Try this before your next speaking situation. Even 30 seconds of this "confidence choreography" can shift your entire presence.

Your future confident self is already inside you - we're just practicing letting it out.

Keep growing,
Peter

P.S. The most successful professionals I coach do this exercise regularly, not just before big presentations. Confidence is a practice, not a one-time event.

You've learned techniques that can transform anxiety into energy, practiced exercises that build confidence muscle by muscle, and seen proof that speaking transformation is absolutely possible.

These conversations are pressure-free. My goal is to provide value whether we work together or not.
