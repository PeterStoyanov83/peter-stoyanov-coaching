## 🔧 **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### 1. Environment Variables (Required)

Set these environment variables in your Render deployment:

```bash
# Email Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url

# Admin Authentication
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_secret_key
ADMIN_EMAIL=peterstoyanov83@gmail.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password
```

### 2. Deploy to Render

1. **Push code to your repository**
2. **Update your Render service** to use the new code
3. **Set environment variables** in Render dashboard
4. **Deploy and verify** the application starts successfully

### 3. Start Email Automation

The email automation needs to run as a separate process. Add this as a background service on Render:

**Background Service Command:**
```bash
python scheduler.py
```

This will:
- Run daily at 9:00 AM to send sequence emails
- Process all active subscribers
- Send weekly emails automatically

## 🔍 **TESTING THE SYSTEM**

### 1. Test Form Submissions
```bash
# Test waitlist registration
curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "full_name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "city_country": "New York, USA",
    "occupation": "Manager",
    "why_join": "To improve leadership skills",
    "skills_to_improve": "Communication, Team Management"
  }'
```

### 2. Test Admin Login
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/admin/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "peterstoyanov83@gmail.com",
    "password": "your_admin_password"
  }'
```

### 3. Test Email Automation
The scheduler will automatically process sequences daily at 9 AM. For testing, you can manually trigger:

```python
python -c "from email_automation import run_email_automation; run_email_automation()"
```

## 🛡️ **SECURITY NOTES**

- **JWT tokens** expire after 24 hours
- **Admin password** is hashed with bcrypt
- **Database queries** use SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent injection
- **Email content** is safely templated and escaped
- **CORS** is configured for your specific domains only

---

## 📈 **MONITORING**

The system logs all activities:
- **Email sends** are logged with SendGrid message IDs
- **Errors** are logged with full stack traces  
- **User actions** are logged for audit trails
- **Sequence progress** is tracked per subscriber

---

## 🆘 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**If emails aren't sending:**
1. Check SENDGRID_API_KEY is set correctly
2. Verify SendGrid account is active
3. Check email logs at `/admin/emails`

**If sequences aren't running:**
1. Ensure scheduler.py is running as background service
2. Check subscriber `is_active` status
3. Verify `last_email_sent_at` timestamps

**If admin dashboard isn't accessible:**
1. Check JWT_SECRET_KEY is set
2. Verify admin credentials
3. Ensure token hasn't expired
