# ✅ Email Automation System - Complete Implementation

Your coaching site now has a fully automated email marketing system! Here's what we've built:

## 🎯 What's Implemented

### 1. **Smart Subscriber Segmentation**
- **Lead Magnet Group**: People who download your Theater Secrets guide
- **Waitlist Group**: People interested in your coaching program  
- **Corporate Group**: Companies interested in corporate training

### 2. **Automated Email Sequences**
- **Lead Magnet Sequence**: 6-email nurture sequence over 7 days
- **Waitlist Sequence**: Targeted follow-up for program interest
- **Segmentation**: Automatically sorts subscribers based on actions

### 3. **Backend Integration**

- **MailerLite Integration**: Automatic subscriber management
- **Error Handling**: System continues working even if MailerLite fails

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Functions (`mailerlite.py`)
```python
# New automation functions added:
- ensure_automation_groups()      # Creates required groups
- add_lead_magnet_subscriber()    # Adds to lead magnet sequence
- add_waitlist_subscriber()       # Adds to waitlist sequence  
- trigger_automation_sequence()   # Triggers specific sequences
- get_automation_campaigns()      # Retrieves campaign data
```

### Updated API Endpoints (`main.py`)
```python
# Lead magnet now triggers automation:
/api/download-guide → add_lead_magnet_subscriber()

# Waitlist now triggers automation:
/api/register → add_waitlist_subscriber()
```

## 📧 Email Automation Flow

### Lead Magnet Sequence (7 days)
1. **Day 0**: Welcome + PDF download
2. **Day 2**: Value story (stage presence mistake)

5. **Day 14**: Program introduction (Confident Communicator)
6. **Day 21**: Final call (urgency + scarcity)

### Waitlist Sequence
